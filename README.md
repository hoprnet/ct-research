# Cover Traffic Research at HOPR

## Measuring network performance
Make sure to read this article to understand what we are measuring and what the expectations are:

Since we are only using REST API to interact with a HOPR node, it should be clear which aspect of the above cited article we are referring to.
Note that the baseline we are trying to determine in terms of latency (i.e., REST API, HTTP-specific) should only be relevant in such an environment.
